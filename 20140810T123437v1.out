  Real time             =    2.11 sec. (3112.74 ticks)
Parallel b&c, 20 threads:
  Real time             =   20.61 sec. (29665.60 ticks)
  Sync time (average)   =   10.17 sec.
  Wait time (average)   =    0.01 sec.
                          ------------
Total (root+branch&cut) =   22.72 sec. (32778.34 ticks)
