  Real time             =    1.57 sec. (2750.99 ticks)
Parallel b&c, 20 threads:
  Real time             =   20.18 sec. (24812.62 ticks)
  Sync time (average)   =    8.21 sec.
  Wait time (average)   =    0.00 sec.
                          ------------
Total (root+branch&cut) =   21.75 sec. (27563.61 ticks)
