Root node processing (before b&c):
  Real time             =    3.40 sec. (6606.28 ticks)
Parallel b&c, 20 threads:
  Real time             =    3.68 sec. (4591.38 ticks)
  Sync time (average)   =    1.94 sec.
  Wait time (average)   =    0.00 sec.
                          ------------
Total (root+branch&cut) =    7.08 sec. (11197.65 ticks)
