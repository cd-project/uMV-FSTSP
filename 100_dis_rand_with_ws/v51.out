Customer 6 served by drone.
Drone fly from 7 at stage 8 to serve 6 and then fly back to 8 at stage 9. 
Truck arcs during this sortie: 7--->8
Truck travel time from stage 8 to 9 is: 14.3259
Total drone travel time: 18.5013
Drone arrival time: 237.337
Truck arrival time: 233.161
Truck departure time = max(d/a, t/a) plus (sl/sr): 238.337
