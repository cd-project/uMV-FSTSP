  Real time             =    1.83 sec. (3750.58 ticks)
Parallel b&c, 20 threads:
  Real time             =    1.88 sec. (2477.31 ticks)
  Sync time (average)   =    0.89 sec.
  Wait time (average)   =    0.00 sec.
                          ------------
Total (root+branch&cut) =    3.71 sec. (6227.89 ticks)
