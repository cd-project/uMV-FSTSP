Root node processing (before b&c):
  Real time             =    1.56 sec. (2630.71 ticks)
Parallel b&c, 20 threads:
  Real time             =   16.21 sec. (24945.97 ticks)
  Sync time (average)   =    8.99 sec.
  Wait time (average)   =    0.01 sec.
                          ------------
Total (root+branch&cut) =   17.77 sec. (27576.69 ticks)
