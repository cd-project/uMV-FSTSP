Root node processing (before b&c):
  Real time             =    2.00 sec. (3536.94 ticks)
Parallel b&c, 20 threads:
  Real time             =   20.77 sec. (27640.84 ticks)
  Sync time (average)   =    9.83 sec.
  Wait time (average)   =    0.01 sec.
                          ------------
Total (root+branch&cut) =   22.77 sec. (31177.77 ticks)
