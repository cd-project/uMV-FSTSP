Customer 5 served by drone.
Drone fly from 10 at stage 7 to serve 5 and then fly back to 9 at stage 8. 
Truck arcs during this sortie: 10--->9
Truck travel time from stage 7 to 8 is: 11.7667
Total drone travel time: 12.7516
Drone arrival time: 125.066
Truck arrival time: 124.081
Truck departure time = max(d/a, t/a) plus (sl/sr): 126.066
